# Recommended Basic Training Pathway (~1 hour)

The following training steps are recommended for familiarizing yourself with the basics of the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) and the OHDSI ecosystem. These resources are designed to help you understand the foundational concepts and tools used in observational health data science using the OMOP CDM and the ATLAS Tool.

## 1. Real World Data and the OMOP CDM (~10 minutes)

- **[What is Real World Data, Real World Evidence?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KX5w_TFNYo&list=PLKudn8e8g-OGNmLatJFfXa8cqubG7cs9H&index=4)**: An introduction to the concepts of Real World Data (RWD) and Real World Evidence (RWE), and their significance in healthcare research, within the context of the OMOP-CDM. The video discusses the EHDEN network, but as made clear in the follow-up video below, the basis for collaboration that EHDEN depends upon is centered on the OMOP-CDM.
- **[What is Federated Data and OMOP?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiemAJwuQjA&list=PLKudn8e8g-OGNmLatJFfXa8cqubG7cs9H&index=3)**: A brief introduction to the concept of federated data and how it relates to the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM).

## 2. How Does the OMOP CDM Work?

### The Standardized Vocabularies (~45 minutes)

The standard vocabularies are foundational to understanding how clinical data and clinical concepts are represented in the OMOP CDM. The following instructional resources rely upon the user having an [EHDEN Academy](https://academy.ehden.eu/my/) account, which is free to create. The following three resources are pieces of EHDEN courses, which provide the minimum information required to work successfully with the OMOP CDM.

- **[Vocabulary Introduction](https://academy.ehden.eu/mod/page/view.php?id=207)**: An overview of the OMOP Vocabulary, which provides standardized terminology for the OMOP CDM.
- **[Concepts](https://academy.ehden.eu/mod/page/view.php?id=208)**: A detailed explanation of *concepts* within the OMOP, including how they are defined and used.
- **[Standardized Concepts](https://academy.ehden.eu/mod/page/view.php?id=211)**: An in-depth look at the standardized vocabularies used in the OMOP CDM, including how they are structured and utilized.

# Recommended Advanced Training (~10 hours)

EHDEN’s base OHDSI tutorials are an important foundation, and have some of the same content as years following (EHDEN training content from 2019). However, the tutorials are a yearly event, and in our experience, the content gets tighter each year. For that reason, we recommend individuals start in the following order with their advanced OMOP training. Ideally, **you should have access to an OMOP-CDM database and are able to put these skills to immediate use**, else risk loosing the knowledge quickly.

- OHDSI2025 Tutorial: An Introduction to the Journey from Data to Evidence Using OHDSI [(link)](https://youtu.be/lELiY5B27ps?si=MbJEGB64mOTsHB7X)
  - Good foundation for answering the question “why even bother with this in the first place”
- EHDEN Course - OMOP CDM and Standardized Vocabularies [(link)](https://academy.ehden.eu/course/view.php?id=4)
  - Good piecemeal content breaking apart CDM and vocabularies

# Next steps

Once you are thoroughly familiar with the OMOP-CDM, you should be able to appropriately utilize tooling against the model, including SQL, R, Python, and GUI applications (White Rabbit, Rabbit in a Hat, Usagi, ATHENA, ATLAS). Please see our "Applications" page for additional details regarding the applications we use. If you're working in Epic and you want to see how Epic concepts are converted to OMOP dimensions, please refer to our "OMOP Primers" for further details.
